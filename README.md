For understanding of Jira as a agile management tool I have done this project by creating an epic, user stories, child stories in the Jira software. Also created dummy team and assigned user stories and child stories to them with story point estimation. How to create sprint and how to run sprint is also covered in this project.How to analyse the board and see how a individual team member is performing, his backlogs and completed task.All these aspects of agile methodologies are performed in this project.

## 2. Project contents

These are contents or steps followed 

#### 2.1 Configuration of Jira

Jira is a commercial software product that can be licensed for running on-premises or available as a hosted application.
Atlassian provides Jira for free to open source projects meeting certain criteria, and to organizations that are non-academic, non-commercial, non-governmental, non-political, non-profit, and secular. For academic and commercial customers, the full source code is available under a developer source license.
But Jira provides totally free cloud based app which we can use for traininng purpose for upto 14 days max.

AS soon as you logged in JIRA app it will show the current runnig project and templates(agile flavours) for new project.
click on scrum it will creat a new project
<br>

#### 2.3 How to add team members into the project

AS you can see i have created a project named 'onlinemart' and added team members.<br>
We can add teams into our project by clicking add people button and it will ask for registered E-mail ID of member in Jira app.
It will show like this

#### 2.4 How to create Epic, User storey and sub tasks

  <b>i. Epic :</b> It is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. An epic can span more than one project, if multiple projects     are included in the board where the epic is created.

  <b>ii. User story :</b> A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user's perspective. A      user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.

  <b>iii. sub task :</b> A subtask is used to broken down a storey into number of parts so that each part can be assigned to different team members to complete.Evvery             issue(bugs, stories or tasks) can be broken down with the use of subtask.

<kbd>![create issu12](https://github.com/Musab9860576525/Jira-as-a-Agile-management-tool/assets/93589142/1a066b00-1071-4d4b-9dfb-4980898c5da1)</kbd>

As you see in Screen Shot you can create any kind of issue in JIRA by clicking on Create button and then it will ask for project name and the type of issue(story, task, bug) you want to create will be shown in the drop down.And then hit on create button. 

#### 2.5 How to creat sprint

<b> Sprint </b> : A sprint is a fixed time period where a team commits to a set number of issues from their backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. At the end of the sprint, a team will typically have built and implemented a working product increment. In Jira Software, sprints are planned on the Backlog screen.

<kbd>![create sprint](https://github.com/Musab9860576525/Jira-as-a-Agile-management-tool/assets/93589142/a6add09a-cd21-4c72-afb6-ef221355b756|width=10)</kbd>

As you can see create sprint button on backlog section by clicking on that you can create a sprint and it will give pop-up window as shown below 

<kbd>![sprint_pop-up](https://github.com/Musab9860576525/Jira-as-a-Agile-management-tool/assets/93589142/aebdae26-947e-4d2c-a1b0-d399ec041397|width=100)</kbd>

Here we can specify sprint name , sprint duration, start time, end time and sprint goal.

#### 2.6 How to add stories to sprint

<kbd>![Assighed stories](https://github.com/Musab9860576525/Jira-as-a-Agile-management-tool/assets/93589142/80f35777-5bc8-48f8-8180-67497cf5c3e5)</kbd>

As you can see we have a one running sprint which has three stories.And in backlog we have to stories to be added to second sprint.Just by dragging the story from backlog dropping it into sprint we can add the stories to the sprints. 
<br>
<br>
Now that we have to seen all the components of backlog page,Now lets see how to use board to see how a individual team member is performing, his backlogs and completed task.

#### 2.7 Updating and analysing of Board 

<kbd>![board2](https://github.com/Musab9860576525/Jira-as-a-Agile-management-tool/assets/93589142/73546e4d-44ba-4db5-a662-e2a516b80574)</kbd>
Boars consist of three section <br>
i. To do <br>
ii. Inprogress <br>
iii. Completed <br>
For each and every sprint.<br>
 <br>
As you can see under "OLMSprint1" I have 3 stories.<br> 
One storey is completed, one is in progress and one even not startes.<br>
By just drag and drop in respective section we can change the status o a story.
